# MarioBrosJava
This game is a simpler recreation of the beloved classic 2D platformer game, Mario Bros.! Progress through 5 levels to collect as many coins as possible, but take care to dodge enemies and projectiles; you only have 3 lives until Game Over!

## How to Run the Program:
This program was tested to run from IntelliJ IDEA's run button, but you can also run it from the terminal in IDEA.

Place all files into a folder titled "src". This will be your working directory. Then set your working directory in the IDEA terminal to src. Then run this line:
`javac *.java`
and then run this line:
`java Project`

## How to Play:
Move Mario with the arrow keys on your keyboard. Press the right arrow to move right and the left arrow to move left. Press the up arrow to jump to the right, and the down arrow to jump backwards. If Mario touches an enemy or a projectile, he will lose a life regardless of where he touches it. You will see coins in almost every level; to add to your score, simply move Mario over a coin.
